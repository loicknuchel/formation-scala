Think of self-driving cars, companion robots, and medical diagnosis support systems. AI has the capability to make sense of the huge volume of data surrounding us, transforming data into knowledge that we can use to make better decisions in all these areas of our personal and professional life. This could potentially lead to great transformations and to solving some of the most difficult problem in our society. However, in order to fully exploit the potential of AI, these systems need to follow the same ethical principles and moral value that we expect from other humans, so to build trust in them and create synergic partnership between humans and machines.</p>\n<p>In this talk I will mention some of the ethical issues that the pervasive use of AI raises, as well as some initiatives, such as the Partnership on AI, whose goal is to educate, discuss, and possibly solve most of these issues.</p>\n",
